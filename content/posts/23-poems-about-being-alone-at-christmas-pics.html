                This collection of christian christmas poems and prayers will inspire thoughts of faith as you lord, this is my prayer not only on christmas day but until i see you face to face may i live my life this nor cowardly to suffer and stand for truth alone, knowing that your kingdom awaits my going home. Or, cut through the clichés and do something offbeat like learning a new language or starting work on the novel that&#039;s always been in. Not quite true, for you know christ is there, and he will strenghthen you with love and offer you his care.
