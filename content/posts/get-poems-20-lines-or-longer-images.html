                The long line is more conclusive and inclusive than the partial, subdivided short line. On late winter days, when the spring is closer and closer, with every more and more confident sun ray, every lighter and longer evening, people&#039;s hearts are awaken with the eternal hunger of love, affection and tenderness. You might think poetry is difficult to understand, but think again!

    <p>Usually they are not meant to be published otherwise. A few short verse paragraphs could be followed by a longer one, then another short one, and so forth. Select from a variety of structures and we&#039;ll do the rhyming, syllable counting and imagery once you&#039;ve made your choice, we&#039;ll ask you for a few words to inspire your poem. Sometimes, when we offer students choice during a poetry unit of study, they get come up empty.</p>
