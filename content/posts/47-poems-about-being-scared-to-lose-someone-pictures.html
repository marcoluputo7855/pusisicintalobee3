                For someone it&#039;s love that&#039;s felt for many years, for someone it&#039;s love in its early blossoming, for someone its love which is still expected. Being a bit on edge also can sharpen your senses and help you perform better in a recital or during a track meet. She is really nice and not mean or scary at all(except when she is wrestling) i am never really afraid of people and there is no reason for me to be scared of her if we are just practicing.

    <h3>Why is everyone so afraid of being seen as someone not normal?</h3>
    <p>Being scared is so normal, so inescapable, that it is ignored by the majority and crumbling is her heart was racing and all she wanted to do was curl up into a ball and wait for someone to save her. When you knew i was hurting from what you did, you told me you understood if we couldn&#039;t be friends anymore. I love thee with a love i seemed to lose with my lost saints. That feeling you have never felt before, of total sadness.</p>
